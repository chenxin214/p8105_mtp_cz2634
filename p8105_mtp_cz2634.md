**Introduction and Goal of the Report**

The raw data record the weights of three dogs named “Simon, Gagne, and
Raisin” over 2 years with a standard object weighed on a dedicated
scale. There are 206 rows and 6 columns. Observations are weight records
of the three dogs through time. It also includes occasional notes mainly
is time spent in a kennel.

The goal of the report is to

**Import, tidy, and clean the data** \* create a tibble for month name
change \* “read\_excel” read the excel, “skip” skip the first raw,
“col\_types” set the column type  
\* use function clean\_names() in janitor packages to clean data  
\* drop the row based on the missing values in var. ‘raisin,simone,
gagne’ \* change the variable type by mutate() \* join two data frame by
left\_join() \* delete columns by select(-\*)

  - change the weights unit from lbs\_oz to lbs for three dogs and the
    standard object
  - separate one column to two by separate()
  - transfer oz to lbs by oz/16

**A dataframe include notes with date** \* change the variable name to
“notes” by mutate() \* drop the row based on the missing values in
var. ‘notes’

**export data frame** \* export the two data fram named weight\_df and
notes\_df as CSVs by function write.csv. \* save the CSVs to the same
directory as the raw data in working directory by giving the path

# Probalem 2

**Briefly describe the resulting tidy dataset containing weights** The
weights data recording the weights of the three dogs and a standard
object has 202 rows and 7 columns. There are 202 unique dates are
included in the dataset.
