## Problem 1 Tidy and clean data

**Introduction and Goal of the Report**

The raw data record the weights of three dogs named “Simon, Gagne, and
Raisin” over 2 years with a standard object weighed. There are 206 rows
and 6 columns. The goal of the report is to analyze the weight
distribution of the three dogs over time.

**Import, tidy, and clean the data**

    ## # ... with 192 more rows

  - The data frame ‘weight\_df’ is more tidy and readable. It delete
    rows where there is no record for weight of all three dogs, but keep
    rows when at least one weight is recorded.

**A dataframe that includes notes with date**

  - In this part, we produce a new data frame that include notes over
    time. There are totall 14 notes which records things happen to dog
    like moving place, hair cut, death of Gagne. All three dogs had hair
    cut on 10/15/2018. Raisin and Simone had another hair cut on
    5/23/2020, while Gagne hadn’t because of the pass away.

**export data frame**

``` r
#export the two data frame named ‘weight_df’ and ‘notes_df’ as CSVs
#Save the CSVs to the same directory as the raw data in working directory by giving the relative path.
write.csv(weight_df, "./data/weight.csv")
write.csv(notes_df, "./data/notes.csv")
```

## Problem 2 Summary of weight

**Briefly describe the resulting tidy dataset containing weights**  
\* The weights data recording the weights of the three dogs and a
standard object has 202 rows and 7 columns. There are 202 unique dates
are included in the dateset. By observation the raw data, there is a
miss recorded value of weight for raisin. The weight of raisin on
8/14/2019 is 7.9375 lbs while the records on near dates are all about
17.93 lbs. To analyze the data accurately, the analysis below will drop
the miss recorded value.

**summary of the weight**

    ## 
    ## 
    ## |dog_name   | mean_weight| sd_weight| observation|
    ## |:----------|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|
    ## |gagne_lbs  |        10.3|       0.7|         119|
    ## |raisin_lbs |        18.3|       0.7|         200|
    ## |simone_lbs |        10.4|       0.4|         192|

  - The data frame ‘dog\_df3’ shows a summary about the number of total
    observation, average weight and the standard deviation for each dog.
    There are observations for gagne, valid observations for raisin, and
    observations for Simone. The mean weight of Raisin is 18.3, while it
    will be 18.2 if we do not drop the miss record value ‘7.9375’. The
    mean weights of Gagne and Simone are very close which are 10.3 and
    10.4 respectively. Both weight values of Gagne and Raisin have a SD
    of 0.7, and the SD of weight value of Simone is 0.4, which reflects
    weight values of Gagne and Raisin are more spread from mean than
    that of Simone. Simone has a relatively stable weight than the
    other.

## Problem 3 Visualization

**two-panel plot**

<img src="p8105_mtp_cz2634_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

  - By visualizing, we can more clearly see the weight difference among
    the three dogs, and the weight distribution over time. Raisin is
    almost two times heavy than the other two dogs. The right pannel
    shows when time close to the death of Gagne, he lost weight over
    time from average 10 lbs to finally 8 lbs. Raisin and Simmon have
    very similar weight gain or lose trend over the two years. When one
    gain/lose weight, the other also gain/lose weight. Ao a summary, the
    fluctuation of weight of Raisin and Simmon are smooth over time.
