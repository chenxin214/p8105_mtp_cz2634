## Probalem 1

**Introduction and Goal of the Report**

The raw data record the weights of three dogs named “Simon, Gagne, and
Raisin” over 2 years with a standard object weighed on a dedicated
scale. There are 206 rows and 6 columns. Observations are weight records
of the three dogs through time. It also includes occasional notes mainly
is time spent in a kennel.

The goal of the report is to

**Import, tidy, and clean the data**

  - In this part, we produce a new data frame that include notes over
    time. There are totall 14 notes which records mainly the place
    changes where the dogs live. All three dogs had hair cut on
    10/15/2018. Raisin and Simone had another hair cut on 5/23/2020,
    while Gagne hadn’t because of the pass away.

**export data frame**  
\* In this part, we export the two data frame named ‘weight\_df’ and
‘notes\_df’ as CSVs by function ‘write.csv’. Save the CSVs to the same
directory as the raw data in working directory by giving the relative
path.

## Probalem 2

**Briefly describe the resulting tidy dataset containing weights**  
\* The weights data recording the weights of the three dogs and a
standard object has 202 rows and 7 columns. There are 202 unique dates
are included in the dateset. By observation the raw data, there is a
miss record value of weight for raisin. The weight of raisin on
8/14/2019 is 7.9375 lbs while the records on near dates are all about
17.93. To analyze the data accurately, the analysis below will drop the
miss recorded value.

**summary of the weight**

    ## 
    ## 
    ## |dog_name   | mean_weight| sd_weight| observation|
    ## |:----------|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|
    ## |gagne_lbs  |        10.3|       0.7|         119|
    ## |raisin_lbs |        18.3|       0.7|         200|
    ## |simone_lbs |        10.4|       0.4|         192|

  - The data frame ‘dog\_df3’ shows a summary about the number of total
    observation, average weight and the standard deviation for each dog.
    There are observations for gagne, valid observations for raisin, and
    obsevations for Simone. The mean weight of Raisin is 18.3, while it
    will be 18.2 if we do not drop the miss record value ‘7.9375’. The
    mean weights of Gagne and Simone are very close which are 10.3 and
    10.4 respectively. Both weight values of Gagne and Raisin have a
    standart deviation of 0.7, and the SD of weight value of Simone is
    0.4. This data reflects weight values of Gagne and Raisin are more
    spread from mean than that of Simone. Simone has a relatively stable
    weight.
